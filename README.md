SWChinaCVM-1.0

This is a reference 3-D P- and S-wave community velocity model of the crust and uppermost mantle in southwest China (SWChinaCVM-1.0, DOI:10.12093/02md.02.2019.01.v1), obtained by joint body and surface wave traveltime tomography. This work is supported by the China Seismic Experimental Site（CSES）. 

* Model Data Format: Lon Lat Dep(km) Vp(km/s) Vs(km/s)

* Method: Joint inversion of body wave (P and S-wave) travel time and Rayleigh wave traveltime data (Fang et al., (2016), JGR).

* Grid space: Horizontally 0.5 degree interval, vetically at depth 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 50, 60, 70 km.

* Depth is relative to the surface (0 km).
